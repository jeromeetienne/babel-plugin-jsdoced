# Features
- no dependancies
- works in node.js and browser
- support source maps
- works with es2015 and react/jsx
- even works with new es6 arrow function
- easily integrable in modern js tools. browserify/webpack/gulp you name it

# Use cases
- Improve your tests
  - jsdoced javascript will detect a new kind of errors.
  - So this is an additional level of testing
  - better detect those bugs before your users see them :)
- Debug build for library
  - any library provide a minified version and a normal version
  - You can provide a jsdoced version 
  - this debug version contains additional code to help debug.
  - thus people can use this one when developping or testing their own project
  - and hopefully detect errors earlier.
  - Specially interesting when you are learning a library. because you are more likely to do mistakes.
    better for your users :)
  - see [/examples/gulpfile](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/babel-plugin-jsdoced/tree/master/examples/gulpfile) for a example on how to that with gulp
